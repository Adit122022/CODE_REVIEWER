 Phase 1: Fix & Polish the VS Code-like Editor UI
Make your code editor:

Styled like VS Code (dark theme, line numbers, better font)

Tailwind CSS powered

Bug-free with Prism.js (no undefined.length error)

🧠 Phase 2: Integrate AI Code Review Suggestions
Add a backend route (Node.js + OpenAI API)

On code change or button click, send code to backend

Display the review/suggestions in the right-hand panel

🔁 Phase 3: Live Room Sharing with Socket.io
Ensure each room is isolated (projectId)

Code updates broadcasted in real-time to everyone in that room

Let’s Start with Phase 1: Fix the Editor
Do you want me to:

Write a clean CodeEditor.jsx from scratch with full Tailwind styling like VS Code, or

Fix your existing one (with line numbers, highlighting, etc.)?
